## 🧠 Overview

This project develops an AI-powered system for early detection and monitoring of mental health crises—including suicide risk, substance use, and emotional distress—using social media data.  

We build a modular NLP pipeline that:  
- Detects high-risk language and suicidal ideation.  
- Classifies sentiment and risk levels.  
- Provides interpretable outputs (word banks, word clouds, metrics).  
- Evaluates model generalization on external datasets (e.g., Kaggle).  

> **Note:** Geospatial trend analysis was considered but not included in this release due to privacy concerns.

## 📌 Key Features

- Unified supervised dataset combining Reddit + public datasets.  
- Data cleaning scripts for deduplication, label unification, and preprocessing.  
- Fine-tuned BERT classifier for suicide risk detection.  
- Sentiment and risk-level classification with VADER + keyword heuristics.  
- Google Trends integration for crisis-related keyword tracking.  
- Word bank and word cloud visualization tools.  
- Evaluation pipeline with confusion matrix, ROC/PR curves, and threshold analysis.

## 🚧 Current Status

✅ Data collection & cleaning completed  
✅ Unified dataset prepared (`unified_supervised_v2.csv`)  
✅ BERT fine-tuning implemented (`train_bert_from_unified.py`)  
✅ Model evaluation on external Kaggle dataset  
✅ Word bank & sentiment risk outputs  
✅ Midterm and final reports (`midterm_report.ipynb`, `final_report.ipynb`)  

🔜 Future work: explainability tools, cross-platform expansion, geospatial trends with privacy safeguards
